# SubUtil

Some useful python script for subtitle (.srt) editing

If there are more than one line subtitle in one block, `cleansub.py` can help you merge these lines in a single line.

If there are two lines in one block, `split_srt.py` can help you split the .srt file into two files in which one contains original language and another contains target language, and then back up the raw .srt file as .srt.bak file.

`restore_srt.py` is the resersed method of `split_srt.py`
